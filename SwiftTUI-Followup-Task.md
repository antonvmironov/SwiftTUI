# SwiftTUI Wishlist Implementation - Follow-up Task

## Overview
Continue the excellent progress on SwiftTUI by implementing the remaining high-priority features from the SwiftTUI wishlist. Build upon the solid foundation established in previous PRs that implemented:

✅ **Completed Features:**
- State Management (Observable, State, Binding, Published)
- Input Handling (onKeyPress, FocusState, KeyEquivalent)
- Advanced Table Component (sorting, selection, SwiftUI API)
- Grid Layout System (LazyVGrid, LazyHGrid, flexible sizing)
- Form Validation System (validators, error display, real-time validation)
- Animation Components (LoadingSpinner, ProgressBar, SkeletonView)
- Enhanced Navigation (NavigationLink improvements)
- **NavigationStack System** (breadcrumb support, NavigationPath, keyboard shortcuts)
- **Enhanced Form Controls** (Picker, Stepper, Slider, formatted input fields)
- **Advanced Input Formatting** (currency, phone, email, date formatters)
- **Animation and Transitions System** (withAnimation, timing curves, animated components)
- **Basic Accessibility Support** (screen reader hints, keyboard navigation)

## Next Implementation Priorities

### 1. **Navigation Stack System** ✅ **COMPLETED** (High Priority)
**Goal**: Implement full NavigationStack with automatic keyboard navigation
- ✅ Complete NavigationStack with breadcrumb support and automatic "Back" handling (Escape key)
- ✅ Automatic keyboard navigation foundation (Tab/Shift+Tab framework ready)
- ✅ `navigationDestination` modifier support (placeholder implementation)
- ✅ Programmatic navigation with `NavigationPath`
- ✅ Terminal-optimized breadcrumb display

**API Target:**
```swift
NavigationStack {
    VStack {
        NavigationLink("Settings", destination: SettingsView())
        NavigationLink("Profile", destination: ProfileView())
    }
}
.navigationDestination(for: String.self) { value in
    DetailView(item: value)
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Form Controls** ✅ **COMPLETED** (High Priority)
**Goal**: Complete the form component ecosystem
- ✅ `Picker` component with dropdown/selection UI
- ✅ `Stepper` for numeric input with +/- controls
- ✅ `Slider` equivalent for terminal environments
- ✅ Number formatters and input masking
- ✅ Professional input validation (currency, phone, email, date)

**API Target:**
```swift
Form {
    Picker("Category", selection: $selectedCategory) {
        ForEach(categories, id: \.self) { category in
            Text(category.name).tag(category.id)
        }
    }
    
    Stepper("Quantity: \(quantity)", value: $quantity, in: 1...100)
    
    TextField.currency("Amount", value: $amount)
    TextField.phone("Phone", text: $phone)
}
```

### 3. **Animation and Transitions** ✅ **COMPLETED** (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Add smooth state transitions and view animations
- ✅ `withAnimation` equivalent for terminal environments
- ✅ View transition animations (slide, fade equivalents)
- ✅ State change animations for property updates
- ✅ Timing curves and animation easing (linear, easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut)
- ✅ Animation modifiers for SwiftUI compatibility
- ✅ Simple animated components (spinners, progress bars, text effects)
- ✅ Interpolation functions for smooth value transitions

**API Target:**
```swift
withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.5)) {
    isExpanded = true
}

Text("Status")
    .foregroundColor(isError ? .red : .green)
    .animation(.default, value: isError)

SimpleSpinner(current: animationFrame)
AnimatableText("Loading...", isHighlighted: isPulsing)
```

### 4. **Advanced Table Features** (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Complete the table component with full interaction
- Row selection with keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Column resizing and reordering
- Table pagination for large datasets
- Context menus and row actions

### 5. **Accessibility and Polish** ✅ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION** (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Ensure professional accessibility and user experience
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility and ARIA-like attributes
- ✅ Enhanced keyboard navigation standards
- ✅ Accessibility modifiers (.accessibilityLabel, .accessibilityHint, .accessibilityRole)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation utility functions
- ✅ Accessible components (AccessibleButton, AccessibleTextField)
- [ ] Terminal size adaptation and responsive design
- [ ] Better error messaging and user feedback
- [ ] Internationalization and localization support

**API Target:**
```swift
Button("Submit")
    .accessibilityLabel("Submit Form")
    .accessibilityHint("Submits the current form data")
    .accessibilityRole(.button)

AccessibleTextField("Email", text: $email)
    .accessibilityHint("Enter your email address for login")
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Swift 6 Compliance**: Use modern concurrency patterns
- **SwiftUI API Compatibility**: Match SwiftUI APIs exactly where possible
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 15+ tests per major component
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility
- **Professional Examples**: Include real-world usage demonstrations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all public APIs
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Migration guides for SwiftUI developers
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Best practices for terminal UI design
- Component usage patterns and recipes

## Success Criteria

### Technical Milestones
1. **Build Success**: All components compile without warnings
2. **Test Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage for new features
3. **API Consistency**: SwiftUI developers can use components immediately
4. **Performance**: Smooth interaction with 1000+ data items
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint growth

### User Experience Goals
1. **Professional Quality**: Enterprise-ready terminal applications
2. **Developer Productivity**: Reduced SwiftUI-to-SwiftTUI porting time
3. **Feature Completeness**: Support for complex business applications
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard-only navigation
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows terminals

## Estimated Scope
- **4-6 new major components** (NavigationStack, Picker, Stepper, Animation system)
- **60+ new tests** across all components
- **4+ demo applications** showing real-world usage
- **Documentation updates** reflecting new capabilities
- **Migration examples** for SwiftUI developers

## Expected Impact
Upon completion, SwiftTUI will provide:
- **Full SwiftUI Compatibility**: Most SwiftUI apps can be ported with minimal changes
- **Professional Terminal Apps**: Support for complex business applications
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Familiar APIs and patterns
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Accessibility, performance, and polish
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Single codebase for GUI and TUI versions

This continued development will establish SwiftTUI as the premier framework for creating professional terminal-based user interfaces with SwiftUI-compatible APIs and patterns.
