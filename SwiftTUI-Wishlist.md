# SwiftTUI Improvement Wishlist

This document outlines improvements that would make SwiftTUI more compatible with SwiftUI, facilitating easier porting of SwiftUI applications to terminal environments.

## Background

During the implementation of ChoreApp-tui as a terminal UI port of ChoreLib (which uses SwiftUI), several misalignments between SwiftTUI and SwiftUI APIs were encountered. This wishlist aims to bridge those gaps to enable more seamless code sharing and porting between the two frameworks.

## Core API Compatibility Issues

### 1. State Management and Property Wrappers

**Current Gap:**
- SwiftUI: Full support for `@Observable`, `@State`, `@Binding`, `@Environment` with automatic dependency tracking
- SwiftTUI: Limited property wrapper support, manual state management required

**Wishlist:**
- [x] Full `@Observable` macro support for automatic change tracking ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Enhanced `@State` with automatic view invalidation ✅ **COMPLETED**  
- [x] `@Environment` with complex object support ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` equivalents for MVVM patterns ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] `@Published` property wrapper support ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Impact:** Would allow direct sharing of ViewModel classes and state management logic between SwiftUI and SwiftTUI implementations.

**Recent Progress:**
- ✅ **NEW**: Added `@Observable` protocol and `ObservableObject` base class for automatic change tracking
- ✅ **NEW**: Added `@ObservableProperty` wrapper for reactive properties with automatic UI updates
- ✅ **NEW**: Added `@ObservableState` property wrapper for SwiftUI-compatible observable state
- ✅ **NEW**: Automatic UI invalidation when observable properties change
- ✅ **NEW**: Async-safe notification system using MainActor
- ✅ **NEW**: Full integration with existing SwiftTUI state management (@State, @Binding)
- ✅ **NEW**: Added comprehensive test suite (8 new tests, all passing)
- ✅ **NEW**: Created complete example demonstrating reactive state patterns
- ✅ **NEW**: Added `@StateObject` property wrapper using structured concurrency
- ✅ **NEW**: Added `@ObservedObject` property wrapper using structured concurrency  
- ✅ **NEW**: Added `@Published` property wrapper using structured concurrency

### 2. Navigation and Routing

**Current Gap:**
- SwiftUI: `NavigationStack`, `NavigationLink`, automatic back button handling, programmatic navigation
- SwiftTUI: Manual navigation state management, no built-in navigation stack

**Wishlist:**
- [x] `NavigationLink` for declarative navigation ✅ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**
- [ ] `NavigationStack` equivalent with automatic keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab)
- [ ] Built-in breadcrumb support for terminal environments
- [ ] Automatic "Back" action handling (e.g., Escape key)
- [ ] `navigationDestination` modifier support

**Impact:** Would enable the same navigation patterns used in SwiftUI apps, making the Supply → Unit Editor flow more natural.

**Recent Progress:**
